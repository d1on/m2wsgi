v0.2.1

    * New method Connection.shutdown() to stop receiving more requests,
      but allow processing of any that are already received.
    * Changed custom request protocol from REQ to XREQ.  It now sends an
      explicit shutdown message to the send socket, to abort a request
      that may already be in the system when shutdown() is called.
    * WSGIHandler._shutdown() now waits for all in-progress requests to
      complete before it terminates the server.

v0.2.0

    * Transparent support for streaming reads of large request bodies.
    * Support for a REQ-based handler protocol as an alternative to
      mongrel2's standard PULL-based protocol.  See m2wsgi/pull2qeue.py.
    * And of course, many bugfixes and WSGI compatability improvements.

v0.1.0

    * initial release; you might say *everything* has changed.
